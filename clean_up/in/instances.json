Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference.\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n* Your messages must only contain valid commands and nothing else, or you both get a penalty.\n* If both players accumulate 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get.

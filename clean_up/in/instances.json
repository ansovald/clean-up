You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: $objects.\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol `$empty_symbol`.\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n* You must not use coordinates or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you lose the game immediately.\n* Your messages must only contain valid commands and nothing else, or you both get a penalty.\n* If both players accumulate $max_penalties penalties, the game ends.\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say (finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get.
